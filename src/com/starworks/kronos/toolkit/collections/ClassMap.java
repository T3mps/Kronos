/**
 * A hash map that stores class indices and assigns them to objects using a
 * {@link ClassValue} field.
 *
 * <p>
 * The `ClassMap` class is a hash map that stores class indices and assigns them
 * to objects using a {@link ClassValue} field. It is used to create a mapping
 * between objects and their corresponding class indices, which can be used to
 * identify objects and group them by type.
 *
 * <p>
 * The `ClassMap` class implements its own hash map using native memory access
 * and the `Unsafe` class from the `sun.misc` package. It uses the identity hash
 * code of an object as the key for the hash map and reduces the significant
 * bits of the hash code using the `m_hashBits` field to reduce the probability
 * of collisions. The class indices are assigned to objects using a
 * {@link ClassValue} field and stored at the appropriate index in the hash map
 * using the `Unsafe.putIntVolatile` method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The `ClassMap` class provides several methods for adding and retrieving
 * objects from the hash map. It also implements the {@link Closeable} interface
 * to allow the native memory used by the hash map to be released when the
 * `ClassMap` instance is no longer needed.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the `ClassMap` class is not thread-safe and does
 * not provide sufficient synchronization for concurrent access and modification
 * by multiple threads. If the ClassMap instance is accessed and modified
 * concurrently by multiple threads, it is recommended to use the getVolatile
 * and getOrIndex methods to ensure thread safety.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation has a fixed m_capacity that is determined by the
 * m_hashBits field and the INT_BYTES_SHIFT constant. The m_capacity is equal to
 * <code> 2 ^ m_hashBits * INT_BYTES_SHIFT</code>. The m_hashBits field is
 * initialized with a default value of 20 bits if no hash bits are specified in
 * the constructor, which results in a m_capacity of approximately 1MB. The
 * INT_BYTES_SHIFT constant is set to 2, which means that the m_capacity is
 * multiplied by 4.
 * <p>
 * The ClassMap class also has a m_atCapacity field that is used to indicate
 * when the class has run out of memory for caching class indices. If the
 * m_atCapacity field is set to true, new objects are not added to the hash map
 * and their previously assigned values are returned instead.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ClassMap classMap = new ClassMap();
 * int index1 = classMap.add(String.class);
 * int index2 = classMap.add(Integer.class);
 * int index3 = classMap.getOrAdd(new Object());
 * System.out.println(index1); // prints 1
 * System.out.println(index2); // prints 2
 * System.out.println(index3); // prints 3
 * classMap.close();
 * </pre>
